    "#### Open MongoDB Charts\n",
    "1. Open a new tab in your browser.\n",
    "1. Navigate to [Atlas](http://bit.ly/cyd-atlas-login).\n",
    "1. If prompted, authenticate.\n",
    "1. In the Context menu in the upper-left corner, select your project.\n",
    "1. In the left menu, click **Charts**. \n",
    "1. If prompted, click **Activate MongoDB Charts**.  MongoDB Charts will open.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add a Data Source\n",
    "A Data Source is a reference to a MongoDB collection that contains the data you wish to visualize.\n",
    "1. In the top menu, click **Data Sources**.\n",
    "1. Click **New Data Source**.\n",
    "1. Select your project and click **Connect**.\n",
    "1. When prompted to choose a collection, select the checkbox on the **ShipInfo** row and click **Set Permissions**.\n",
    "1. Click **Publish Data Source**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Dashboard\n",
    "A dashboard is a place where you can display one or more charts.\n",
    "1. In the top menu, click **Dashboards**.\n",
    "1. Click **New Dashboard**.\n",
    "1. Leave the default title and description for your dashboard and click **Create**.\n",

    "1. Click **My Dashboard**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Map of the Shipwrecks\n",
    "1. Click **Add Chart**.\n",
    "1. *The first thing we need to do is choose what data we want to visualize. Let's say we want to see a map of shipwrecks where only the distributed remains are still available.  We also want to be able to see at a glance the history of the wreck.*\n",
    "1. In the **Choose a Data Source** selection box, select **ShipInfo.shipwrecks**. *Now we can see a list of fields I can choose to use in my chart.  Let's begin by creating a visualization of where the shipwrecks occurred.*\n",
    "1. In the Chart Type selection box, choose **Geospatial** and then click **Scatter**.\n",
    "1. Drag **coordinates** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Coordinates** section of the Encode pane. *Now we can see a map of the shipwrecks. This chart type only supports 1,000 documents, so we'll filter some of the results in a moment.*\n",
    "1. Drag **history** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Color** section of the Encode pane. *Let's give our users a visual indicator of the wreck feature types.*\n",
    "1. Click the **Filter** tab.  \n",
    "1. Drag **feature_type** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Chart Filters** section of the **Filter** pane.  \n",
    "1. **Deselect All** of the boxes in the Chart Filters.\n",
    "1. Select the checkbox beside **distributed remains of wreck**. *Now we can see a nice visualization of the shipwrecks. We have limited our results to only display shipwrecks where the feature type is distributed reamins of wreck.*\n",
    "1. Above the map, click **Enter a title for your chart**, input **Map of wrecks with distributed remains**, and click the checkbox. *Let's give our map a title.*\n",
    "1. *Now that we have a nice visualization, let's save it.* In the upper-left corner, click **Save and Close**.\n",
    "1. *We want our dashboard to look nice, so let's adjust the size of the chart.* Drag the bottom-right corner of the chart to make it bigger.\n",

    "### Chart the Wreck Types\n",
    "1. *Let's create a different type of visualization.  Let's say we want to see what wreck types are the most popular.*\n",
    "1. Click **Add Chart**.\n",
    "1. In the **Choose a Data Source** selection box, select **ShipInfo.shipwrecks**. *Once again, we need to select our data source. If we had multiple collections, we could select a different data source here.*\n",
    "1. In the Chart Type selection box, choose **Circular**.\n",
    "1. Drag **feature_type** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Label** section of the Encode pane. \n",
    "1. Drag **feature_type** from the Fields pane and drop it on the **Arc** section of the Encode pane. *Now we can see a nice visualization of the shipwrecks.*\n",
    "1. *Let's give our map a title.*  Above the map, hover your mouse over **Enter a title for your chart**, click the Pencil button that appears, input **Types of Wrecks**, and click the Checkmark button. \n",
    "1. *Now that we have a nice visualization, let's save it.* In the upper-left corner, click **Save and Close**.\n",
    "1. Adjust the size of the chart if you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now we have two charts on our dashboard.  We could add several more charts to this dashboard if we'd like.  We could then share this dashboard with project stakeholders so they could easily see what is happening in the app.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embed the Wreck Types Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "*In addition to sharing the dashboard, you may want to display the chart in your app or on a webpage like a blog.*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your MongoDB Charts dashboard, hover over the Types of Wrecks chart, click the Options button (**...**) in the upper-right corner of the chart, and select **Embed Chart**.\n",
    "1. *Some data is private and you will only want certain users to be able to view it.  MongoDB Charts has authentication options to help you keep your data secure. In this case, our data is not private, so we'll enable unauthenticated access.* Click **Enable embedding options**.\n",
    "1. Switch the **Enable external embedding for charts that use this data source** option to **ON**.\n",
    "1. Choose the **Unauthenticated or Verified Signature** option.\n",
    "1. Click **Go Back**.\n",
    "1. Switch **Enable unauthenticated access** to **ON**. \n",
    "1. Copy the entire src url from inside the EMBED CODE. You should not copy the quotations. For example, the src url you copy should look something like `https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-team1-ximow/embed/charts?id=69fa82ce-d97f-4dc1-bc9b-404f8af7db6b&tenant=50e4d10e-b0a9-4e28-8c62-02c61b58f69a`. *If you were going to embed this in a webpage, you could copy this entire code snippet and paste it into your webpage. Since we want to embed in a Jupyter Notebook, we're going to do things a little differently.*\n",
    "1. Inside of this Jupyter notebook, paste the url in the code snippet below and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In only a few minutes, you've created a nice visualization of data and displayed it externally.  You didn't have to do any programming to make that happen.  Keep this capability in mind as you build your apps.  It might save you a lot of time to use MongoDB Charts instead of manually programming visualizations.*\n"
